# MiMiNet
MiMiNet is a project demonstrating how Wi‑Fi probe requests from nearby devices can be captured and how a simple captive portal system can be deployed using low-cost hardware. Inspired by commercial tools like the WiFi Pineapple, it focuses on learning, experimentation and affordability rather than commercial deployment.
